This repo is intended to build an environment for practising Postgres using Python Notebook.

## References:

The [Adventure Works 2014 OLTP Script](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks-oltp-install-script.zip) can be downloaded directly from Microsoft's Github repository.

_NOTE: You will need to rename the Adventure Works 2014 OLTP Script archive to **adventure_works_2014_OLTP_script.zip** and place in in the `postgres/` directory!_

The database setup was inspired from the [AdventureWorks-for-Postgres](https://github.com/lorint/AdventureWorks-for-Postgres) repository.
